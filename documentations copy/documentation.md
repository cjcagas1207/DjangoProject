## Technical Implementation

### Template Structure
The form is implemented using Django templates with the following components:
- Extends a base template (`base.html`)
- Uses Django's CSRF protection
- Implements responsive design with TailwindCSS

### Form Submission
- Method: POST
- Enctype: multipart/form-data (supports file uploads)
- Action: Submitted to the current page

### JavaScript Functionality
The form uses jQuery to enable dynamic addition of form sections:
- Each "Add" button clones the respective entry template
- JavaScript functions append cloned entries to their container elements

### Form Validation
Basic form validation is implemented using HTML5 validation attributes:
- Required fields are marked with the `required` attribute
- Email fields use the `type="email"` attribute for validation
- Phone fields use the `type="tel"` attribute for formatting

## Integration with Django
This template is designed to work with a Django view that:
1. Renders the initial form with any pre-populated data
2. Processes the form submission
3. Stores the application data in the database
4. Associates the application with the specific job posting

## Usage Instructions
1. Applicants navigate to a job posting
2. They click "Apply" to access this form
3. They fill out all required sections
4. They can add multiple entries for experience, education, skills, etc.
5. They submit the application using the "Submit Application" button
